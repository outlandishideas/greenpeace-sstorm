## Page notes

Forecast page is reachable in 2 ways:

* after registration if a bad weather event is coming
* from SMS link otherwise

If you just registered it will include a line of copy (or "toast") saying you're signed up.

If you register when weather is OK you go to the standalone RegisteredConfirmationPage.
